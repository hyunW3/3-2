Overview

Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lungs. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi cause it.

coughing that may produce phlegm (mucus)
fever
sweating or chills
shortness of breath that happens while doing normal activities or even while resting
chest pain that’s worse when you breathe or cough
feelings of tiredness or fatigue
loss of appetite
nausea or vomiting
headaches
Other symptoms can vary according to your age and general health:

Children under 5 years old may have fast breathing or wheezing.
Infants may appear to have no symptoms, but sometimes they may vomit, lack energy, or have trouble drinking or eating.
Older people may have milder symptoms. They can also exhibit confusion or a lower than normal body temperature.

Causes of pneumonia
There are several types of infectious agents that can cause pneumonia.

Bacterial pneumonia
The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other causes include:

Mycoplasma pneumoniae
Haemophilus influenzae
Legionella pneumophila
Viral pneumonia
Respiratory viruses are often the cause of pneumonia. Some examples include:

influenza (flu)
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
rhinoviruses (common cold)
Viral pneumonia is usually milder and can improve in one to three weeks without treatment.

Fungal pneumonia
Fungi from soil or bird droppings can cause pneumonia. They most often cause pneumonia in people with weakened immune systems. Examples of fungi that can cause pneumonia include:

Pneumocystis jirovecii
Cryptococcus species
Histoplasmosis species
Types of pneumonia
Pneumonia can also be classified according to where or how it was acquired.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)
This type of bacterial pneumonia is acquired during a hospital stay. It can be more serious than other types, as the bacteria involved may be more resistant to antibiotics.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) refers to pneumonia that’s acquired outside of a medical or institutional setting.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
When people who are using a ventilator get pneumonia, it’s called VAP.

Aspiration pneumonia
Aspiration pneumonia happens when you inhale bacteria into your lungs from food, drink, or saliva. This type is more likely to occur if you have a swallowing problem or if you’re too sedate from the use of medications, alcohol, or other drugs.
