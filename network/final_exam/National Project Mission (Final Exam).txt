National Project Mission (Final Exam)

 
You are the Minister of Science and Technology in Greatest Kingdom (a virtual country). Your  President wants to start a new national project called “Smart X” including Smart City, Smart Factory, Smart Healthcare, Smart Military and so on.

Assume that the fourth generation (4G) mobile communication, LTE, has been widely deployed in Greatest Kingdom, but 5G (fifth generation) mobile communication has NOT been deployed at all.

The President has asked you “what is 5G (fifth generation) mobile communication?”, and “is really 5G needed for the national project, Smart X?”.

 
Your mission is to thoroughly investigate 5G, and let the president understand what 5G is. You should reasonably suggest whether 5G is required to achieve the Smart X project or not. To do this, write a report (PDF) within 5 pages in either Korean or English.

The report MUST include the following;

1. Describe what 5G is, how 5G is different from 4G/LTE.
2. Present how 5G can be applied to the national project, Smart X by using the specific examples.
3. What should be considered when deploying 5G for the Smart X project?
4. Conclude with your final opinion on national investment in upgrading 5G.
* Use good diagrams, images, graphs to persuade the President effectively.

 
Any information you refer in the report, you MUST explicitly indicate the source of the information.
